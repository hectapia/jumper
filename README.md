Jumper
In the Jumper game, you have to identify all missing letters when you only can know the spaces that compound one hidden word. One parachute jumper is implicated. If you don’t guess the right letter then you put at risk to the parachute jumper so avoid making mistakes.

Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

python jumper
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
